## Deploy your own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)][vercel-deploy]

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example cms-sanity next-sanity-blog
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example cms-sanity next-sanity-blog
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example cms-sanity next-sanity-blog
```

Whenever you edit a GROQ query you update the TypeScript types by running:

```bash
npm run typegen
```

## Step 1. Set up the environment

### Reuse remote envionment variables

If you started with [deploying your own](#deploy-your-own) then you can run this to reuse the environment variables from the Vercel project and skip to the next step:

```bash
npx vercel link
npx vercel pull
```

### Using the Sanity CLI

Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` to get started:

```bash
cp -i .env.local.example .env.local
```

Run the setup command to get setup with a Sanity project, dataset and their relevant environment variables:

```bash
npm run setup
```

```bash
yarn setup
```

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

You'll be asked multiple questions, here's a sample output of what you can expect:

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
sanity@3.30.1
Ok to proceed? (y) y

Prefer web interfaces to terminals?
You can also set up best practice Sanity projects with
your favorite frontends on https://www.sanity.io/templates

Looks like you already have a Sanity-account. Sweet!

```

It's important that when you're asked `Would you like to add configuration files for a Sanity project in this Next.js folder?` that you answer `No` as this example is alredy setup with the required configuration files.
